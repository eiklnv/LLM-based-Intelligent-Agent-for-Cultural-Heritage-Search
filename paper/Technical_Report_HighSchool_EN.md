# My Tech Report: A Smart AI for Finding Historical Stuff

## Abstract

Finding info about cool historical artifacts online is surprisingly hard. The information is scattered across tons of different museum websites, everything is named differently, and normal search engines don't really get what you're asking. It’s like trying to solve a puzzle with pieces missing from different boxes.

To fix this, I built a smart AI agent that uses Large Language Models (the same tech behind things like ChatGPT) to do the hard work for you. This agent can understand your questions in plain English, figure out the best way to search the web, and pull together all the information from different websites into one neat report. It's like having a super-smart research assistant for history class!

# 1. Introduction

## 1.1 The Problem

Have you ever tried to look up an ancient artifact for a school project? It can be a real headache. You have to jump between a dozen different museum websites, and they all describe things differently. It feels like you spend more time fighting with the search bar than actually learning.

The main problems are:
1.  **Information is all over the place**: Stuff from the same time period might be in museums all over the world, each with its own website.
2.  **No standards**: One museum might call an object a "vase," while another calls a similar one a "beaker." This makes searching impossible.
3.  **Dumb search**: If you search for "art on the Silk Road," most search engines just look for those keywords and give you a messy list of links. They don't understand the history or geography behind your question.
4.  **Bad user experience**: You have to do all the work of clicking, reading, comparing, and summarizing.

This makes it hard for students to do research, for teachers to find examples, and for anyone who's just curious about history to learn.

## 1.2 How I'm Solving It

People have tried to fix this with better databases or even using AI to recognize pictures, but these solutions don't solve the whole problem. They are often just patches on one part of the issue.

That's why I decided to build something better: **a smart AI agent that acts like your personal history detective**. It uses a powerful Large Language Model to understand what you're asking, searches across the internet, and puts all the pieces together for you. It can understand complex questions, plan a search strategy, and deliver a clean summary.

# 2. How the AI Agent Works

## 2.1 The Big Picture: System Architecture

I designed my system in five main parts that work together like a team. Think of it like a research workflow.

-   **1. User Interface Layer**: This is what you see—the website or command line where you type your question (e.g., "Tell me about Han Dynasty bronze mirrors").
-   **2. Agent Core Layer**: This is the "brain" of the operation. It figures out what you want using a cool method called **ReAct**. This means it **Reasons** about the best plan, **Acts** on it (like searching the web), and **Observes** the results to see if it's on the right track. It's a smart loop that helps it think like a person.
-   **3. Tool Layer**: This is the agent's toolbox. It has tools for searching the internet (using a cool meta-search engine called SearXNG) and for reading and understanding the content of websites.
-   **4. Knowledge Layer**: This is its memory. It has a small knowledge base about cultural heritage and can cache results so it doesn't have to search for the same thing twice.
-   **5. Output Layer**: This part takes all the messy information the agent found and cleans it up into a nice, easy-to-read report for you.

All these parts talk to each other to take your simple question and turn it into a detailed answer.

## 2.2 The Secret Sauce: Key Technologies

So, how does the agent do all this? There are a few key tricks I programmed into it.

-   **Smart Search Planning**: Instead of just googling the first thing that comes to mind, the agent actually thinks about the best keywords and places to look. For a query like "Tang Sancai horses," it knows to search for the main topic but also related terms like "glaze techniques" or "Tang Dynasty tombs."

-   **Checking Its Work (Validation & Reflection)**: The agent doesn't just trust the first thing it finds. It does multiple rounds of searching to double-check facts. It compares info from museum sites, encyclopedia pages, and academic articles to make sure everything is accurate. After each round, it "reflects" on what it found and asks itself: "Is this a good answer? Am I missing anything?"

-   **Putting It All Together (Fusion & Deduplication)**: The agent can look at information from ten different websites about the same artifact, figure out what's a repeat, and merge all the unique details into one complete profile. It can even spot when two sources disagree (like on a date) and will flag the conflict for you instead of just guessing.

-   **Quality Control**: The agent scores the information it finds based on where it came from. A university or museum website gets a high score, while a random blog gets a low score. This helps it decide which facts to trust when building the final report.

# 3. The Demo App and Test Cases

## 3.1 What I Built

I created a real working demo of this system. You can use it in two ways:
1.  **A command-line tool (CLI)** for us nerds who like typing in a terminal.
2.  **A simple web app (using Streamlit)** that gives you a nice visual interface.

Both versions let you type in a query, and then they show you the agent's thought process as it works, finally delivering a structured report.

## 3.2 The Tech I Used

I built this project using Python, which is great for AI stuff. The main libraries and tools I used were:
-   **LangChain**: A framework that makes it much easier to build applications with Large Language Models.
-   **OpenAI's LLMs**: For the "brain" of the agent (though it can be configured to use other models).
-   **SearXNG**: A private meta-search engine that pulls results from Google, Bing, etc., without tracking you.
-   **BeautifulSoup4**: A Python library for pulling data out of HTML websites.
-   **Streamlit**: A super easy way to create simple web apps for Python projects.

## 3.3 How to Use It

Setting it up is pretty straightforward:
1.  Install the Python dependencies from the `requirements.txt` file.
2.  Set up your API keys for the language model in an environment variable or config file.
3.  Run `python run_web.py` to start the web app, or `python run_cli.py` for the terminal version.

## 3.4 Did It Work? (Case Studies)

I tested the agent with a few different types of questions to see how well it performed. (Note: The results here are just summaries of what the agent would produce).

### Case 1: Finding a Specific Thing
-   **My Query**: "Galloping Horse Treading on a Flying Swallow"
-   **How it Did**: The agent quickly identified this as a famous Chinese statue. It prioritized search results from museums and encyclopedias, gathered the core facts (dynasty, material, location), and presented them in a neat little profile. Success!


### Case 2: Exploring a Big Idea
-   **My Query**: "Buddhist art on the Silk Road, important sites, and representative collections"
-   **How it Did**: For this big, open-ended question, the agent went step-by-step. First, it searched for "Silk Road Buddhist art" to get an overview. Then it did specific searches for key sites it identified, like the "Dunhuang Caves." Finally, it looked up which museums held collections from those sites. It produced a report that connected the geography, religion, and art, which is way more than a simple search could do.

# 4. Conclusion and What's Next

## 4.1 What I Accomplished

This project was a success! I built a complete, end-to-end system that uses an AI agent to make history research easier and more powerful.
-   I designed a smart architecture where different parts work together.
-   The agent can intelligently plan its searches, not just google blindly.
-   It automatically cross-references and validates information to ensure accuracy.
-   It can merge messy data from multiple websites into a single, clean report.
-   I built two working interfaces (CLI and Web) to show that it's a real tool, not just an idea.

## 4.2 Where This Could Be Used

This isn't just a fun school project. It could be genuinely useful for:
-   **Students**: To get a head start on research papers with reliable, well-sourced information.
-   **Teachers**: To quickly find and assemble materials for their lessons.
-   **Museums**: To help visitors learn more or even to help curators plan new exhibits.
-   **Anyone Curious**: To make learning about history and art more accessible and fun.

## 4.3 What's Next for the Project

I have a lot of ideas for how to make this even better.
-   **Short-term**: I want to improve the AI's prompts to make it even smarter at planning and make the final reports look nicer with better formatting and pictures.
-   **Mid-term**: I'd love to add support for other languages and maybe even let it search for images, not just text. It would also be cool to connect it to a knowledge graph to help it understand the relationships between different historical figures, places, and events.
-   **Long-term**: The ultimate goal would be to integrate this directly with museum APIs. Imagine an agent that could search the internal databases of the world's biggest museums!

## 4.4 Challenges and Limitations

Of course, the project isn't perfect. It relies on the quality of information on the web, so if a website is wrong, the agent might get confused (though the cross-validation helps prevent this). The AI can also sometimes "hallucinate" or make things up, which is why sticking to reliable sources is so important. Finally, it can be a bit slow and expensive to run because it makes a lot of calls to the AI model.

## 4.5 Final Thoughts

This project showed me that by combining the power of Large Language Models with smart software design, we can build tools that really help us learn and explore. It was a ton of fun to build, and I'm excited to see how I can improve it in the future.
