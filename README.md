# LLM-based-Intelligent-Agent-for-Cultural-Heritage-Search

In the digital age, accessing and utilizing cultural heritage information is impeded by significant challenges, including fragmented systems, non-standardized metadata, insufficient semantic understanding, and poor user experience. Existing solutions, ranging from traditional retrieval systems and knowledge graphs to computer vision and recommender systems, have only partially addressed these issues, often resulting in isolated, inefficient, and unintelligent information access. This fragmentation hinders academic research, educational development, and broader cultural dissemination, creating information silos that prevent a holistic understanding of our shared history.

To overcome these limitations, this report introduces an end-to-end intelligent agent for cultural heritage search, built upon the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). The proposed system employs a multi-layered, loosely coupled architecture centered around a ReAct (Reasoning-Acting-Observing) framework. This architecture comprises five core layers: User Interaction, Agent Core, Tool Invocation, Knowledge Management, and Output Processing. The agent intelligently interprets users' natural language queries, devises dynamic search plans, and executes them by invoking a suite of tools, including a SearXNG-based meta-search engine and web content parsers.

Key innovations of this system include an intelligent search planning algorithm, a multi-round validation and reflection mechanism to ensure accuracy, and a sophisticated cross-source information fusion and deduplication process. The agent autonomously assesses the quality of retrieved information based on source credibility, content accuracy, and completeness, resolving conflicts and aggregating data into structured, user-friendly reports. The system is implemented in Python, leveraging frameworks such as LangChain and Streamlit, and is designed for high extensibility and maintainability. By seamlessly integrating the advanced reasoning capacity of LLMs with robust information retrieval techniques, this intelligent agent provides a unified, efficient, and deeply contextualized search experience, unlocking new potential for research, education, and cultural engagement.
